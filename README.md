# RoboMagellan-2017
This is the code for a fully-autonomous robot designed to compete in the 2017 [Robogames](http://robogames.net/index.php)
[RoboMagellan](http://robogames.net/index.php) competition. The robot, named MONTY III, is based on a modified remote-control
model car and combines GPS, compass, odometer, and camera data to navigate the course per the rules of the competition. You can
see MONTY in action in [this video](http://robogames.net/index.php).

Obviously a lot of this code is hardware-specific but feel free to use it if you want. Note: autonomous robots can go wrong in
spectacular ways and we are not liable for any damage of injury caused. (Pro tip: make installing a kill switch a priority). We'll
formalize this with an open source license if anyone wants one.
